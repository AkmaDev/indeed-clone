# Indeed Clone - Learning Project

Welcome to the Indeed Clone Learning Project! While it may not replicate all the features of the full Indeed website, it serves as an excellent starting point to practice and acquire new skills.

## Project Overview

This project is a practical exercise in building a job search platform inspired by Indeed.  An opportunity to gain hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React.js**: The project's frontend is built with React, a versatile library for creating dynamic user interfaces. We've used React to craft an interactive user experience.

- **Material-UI**: Material-UI is utilized for a clean and modern design, ensuring responsive layouts and intuitive navigation.

### Backend
- **Spring Boot**: The backend leverages Spring Boot to simplify application development. It's an ideal framework for managing business logic and handling API requests.

- **Hibernate**: Hibernate is integrated for streamlined database operations, providing a foundation for data persistence.

### Database
- **MongoDB (Atlas)**: MongoDB, hosted on Atlas, is our database choice. Atlas offers a cloud-based solution for database storage and management.

## Project Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: While not as extensive as the original Indeed platform, our project focuses on delivering a user-friendly interface to enhance the job search experience.

- **Basic Search**: Users can search for jobs.

- **Simplified Job Listings**: Job listings display key details, including job title, type, salary, description, experience required, and technologies involved.
